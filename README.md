## trouble

You may get an error that invlaid modules or some modules can not be found. 
This is because some DLLs are missing on your PC. 
You have to install "Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2013" from 
[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784),
and make sure the installed DLLs can be found in `%PATH%`.
I have copied three dependences, it should work on most PCs. 
But if it cannot, please install the Redistributable Pacages by yourself.
